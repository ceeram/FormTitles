With the FormTitles helper you can easily add the "title" attribute of your Form input and label elements.
It extends core FormHelper, and its easy to drop into your applications in 2.0 as you can now alias the Helpers.
You would put the following in your (App)Controller:

public $helpers = array('Form' => array('className' => 'FormTitles.FormTitles'));

Tests are included and extend core FormHelperTest, so without attaching the included SchemAddBehavior the FormTitlesHelper will behave exactly like regular FormHelper

There are several ways you can set up your model to get the titles loaded for the forms.
For all 3 methods you need to add SchemAddBehavior to your model.

-   If you have defined $_schema in your model, you can just add the keys "title" and "labelTitle" for the fields.
    This method is recommended if you already have defined $_schema property already

Let's use Post model as example:

<?php

class Post extends AppModel {

    public $_schema = array(
		'id' => array(
                    'type' => 'integer',
                    'key' => 'primary'
                ),
		'name' => array(
                    'type' => 'string',
                    'null' => false,
                    'title' => 'This is the input title for the post name',
                    'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
                ),
		'body' => array(
                    'type' => 'text',
                    'title' => 'This is the input title for the body',
                    'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
                ),
		'published' => array(
                    'type' => 'string',
                    'length' => 1,
                    'default' => 'N'
                ),
		'created' => 'datetime',
		'updated' => 'datetime'
	);

}

?>
-   You can define $schema(note the missing underscore) attribute in your model, with just "title" and "labelTitle" keys

This would look something like:

public $schema = array(
    'name' => array(
        'title' => 'This is the input title for the post name',
        'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
    ),
    'body' => array(
        'title' => 'This is the input title for the body',
        'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
    ),
);

-   The last option you have would be by passing it to the $settings array of the behavior.

That would look something like:

public $actsAs = array(
    'FormTitles.SchemAdd' => array(
        'name' => array(
            'title' => 'This is the input title for the post name',
            'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
        ),
        'body' => array(
            'title' => 'This is the input title for the body',
            'labelTitle' => 'This is the title for the label'
        ),
    )
);

The order of above methods is also the same when you would combine a few.
You can set global title in AppModel when you attach the behavior, if $schema is set that will be used instead.
If the titles have been set in $_schema they wont be changed at all, by the other methods used


Because you can't override protected attribute $_schema from the behavior, you need to override schema() in AppModel with the following code:


    function schema($field = false) {
        $_schema = parent::schema($field);
        if ($field || !$this->Behaviors->attached('SchemAdd')) {
           return $_schema;
        }
        return $this->addTitles($_schema);
    }
